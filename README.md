## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **Pygame** - For graphical arcade-style games (Snake, Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris, T-Rex Run)
- **Tkinter** - For GUI applications (Calculator, Alarm Clock, Paint Program)
- **Random** - For game mechanics and randomization
- **JSON** - For data persistence in management apps

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version
```

### Install Dependencies
Some games require Pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Run the Game Launcher
Use the main launcher to browse and play any game:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Run Individual Games
You can also run any game directly:

```bash
python game_01_fortune_cookie.py
python game_36_snake_game.py
# etc.
```
